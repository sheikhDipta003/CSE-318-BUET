-The objective is to capture more stones than your opponent.
-Initially, 
 Each player sits opposite each other facing the long side of
 the board. Set up by giving each player 24 stones. A player 
 places four stones into each of the bins closest to them. 
 The stores are placed at to the right of the board and 
 remain empty of stones.
 
- Decide who goes first with a coin flip or other method
- If you pass over another player's store during your turn, 
  you do not place a stone in their bin.
- When dropping stones into bins, you can drop one into 
  your own store. If it's your last stone in your hand, you 
  get another turn.
- If you go first, pick up the stones in the fourth bin away 
  from your store. That way, you'll place the last stone in 
  your store, and you'll get a free turn.
- By dropping your last stone into an empty bin on your side, 
  you're allowed to take your opponent's stones that are in 
  the opposite bin and place them in your own store.
- The game ends when one player has emptied the six bins on 
  their side. The other player then takes all the stones on
  their own side and places them into their store.
